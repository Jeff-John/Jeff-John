Welcome to my github!
I am a senior Computer Science Student at the University of Houston. I am strongly interested in Data Science, particularly its application in business and finance, and do many personal projects in those spaces. A small sample of those projects is available in the Equity-Models repository. These projects range from online data scalping to ml time series forecasting.
